We have created a short in-browser tutorial using the Katacoda platform, that will guide you through getting started with Pact and Pactflow.

In the scenario, you will create your first contract, publish it to Pactflow, verify it on your provider and learn how to gate deployments using the `can-i-deploy` tool.

The course is written in NodeJS, however, extensive experience with the language will not be required for the workshop.

## Goals

Ultimately, our goal is to get you up and integrated with Pactflow as quickly as possible!

You will:

1. Learn the basic concepts of Pact.
1. Get hands-on experience with the key aspects of writing, publishing and verifying pacts.
1. See how Pactflow fits into the picture so that you can get up and running quickly.
