title: API token permissions
---

API tokens inherit their permissions from their associated user.

## Read/write

A read/write token allows a user to perform any action through the API that its user's permissions allow.

## Read only

A read only token only allows a user to perform *read* actions on the resources that their permissions allow them access to.
